## Controlled Forms and Event Callback handlers
- State represent things on your DOM that can change 
- Forms are things on the DOM that can change

A good practice is to have all forms/inputs control state
 - and in turn, the state should control the form!
 - no more document.querySelector to get values because data is always in the state!




### Mod 3 Thinking:
 - When <some event> happens, I want to manipulate the DOM <how>?

### Mod 4 Thinking: 
 - When <some event> happens, I want to manipulate state in order to manipulat the DOM

 

## On Your Own
