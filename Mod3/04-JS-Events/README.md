# Event Listeners

## Asynchronous vs Synchronous?

## .addEventListener() on a DOM node
- takes in a string for the name of the event, and a callback function to be invoked when the event happens
- (optional) argument for the callback is the event itself

## Example of Events


## When to add an event Listener
- on load of page?
- on creation of element?

## Practice
- When click of email -> alert("sent an email")
- When click of submit -> add new instructor

## Some events have default behavior
- event.preventDefault()

## event.currentTarget vs. event.target
- event.currentTarget: the HTML element addEventListener is attached to
- event.target: the innermost node that triggers the event
