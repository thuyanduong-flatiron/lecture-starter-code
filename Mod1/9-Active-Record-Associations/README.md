## ActiveRecord Modeling Conventions
- file called `doctor.rb` defines a class `Doctor`
- table is called `doctors`
- migration often called `create_doctors`; file name and class name must match (words, not title case)
`belongs_to :doctor`
`has_many :patients`


## Migrations
- addition to the database
- "version control"
- set of changes to the shape of our database

### Steps
1. create migration
2. run migration
3. create the model

## Domain
