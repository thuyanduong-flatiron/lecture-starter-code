# Lectures
- Flipped Classroom style
- Learning coding may be very different from learning anything else
- Absorb what you can, be present in lecture, apply yourself after
  - Lecture code and video is always available later, faster speed and CC
- Asking questions and saying "I don't know" is the norm
  - Imposter Syndrome
- My Lecture style 


# Hashketball Review
- Text Editor shortcuts
- TDD
- rspec; rspec --fail-fast
    - or a specific test: `rspec ./spec/hashketball_spec.rb:28`

- Don't do too much at once. Code a little, test a little
